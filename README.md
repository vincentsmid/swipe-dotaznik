# julca_bakalarka

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## UV

This project uses uv. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run -m julca_bakalarka
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about uv here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload and exposed ports add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "JULCA_BAKALARKA_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "julca_bakalarka/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "JULCA_BAKALARKA_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `julca_bakalarka.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
JULCA_BAKALARKA_RELOAD="True"
JULCA_BAKALARKA_PORT="8000"
JULCA_BAKALARKA_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* mypy (validates types);
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:
```bash
# You have to set a PICCOLO_CONF variable
export PICCOLO_CONF="julca_bakalarka.piccolo_conf"
# Now you can easily run migrations using 
piccolo migrations forwards all
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:
```bash
```


## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.


2. Run the pytest.
